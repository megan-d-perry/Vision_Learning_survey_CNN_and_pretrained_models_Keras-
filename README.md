# Vision Learning survey of CNN & pretrained models Keras:
A survey of DL vision models


<br>
Here is my Facial emotion recognition project.  Be sure to look for my FastAI version, too. This technology has a wide range of applications, including in healthcare, marketing, and gaming.
<br>
The project involves using machine learning algorithms to detect emotions from facial expressions. Trained from a dataset of a wide range of facial expressions, using TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that allows developers to build and deploy machine learning models. 
<br>
I survey multiple models, including ANN, CNN, pre-trained, and more complex CNN models, to achieve the best result from the selection.
Next steps can be using the model to recognize emotions in real-time using a webcam or other camera.
