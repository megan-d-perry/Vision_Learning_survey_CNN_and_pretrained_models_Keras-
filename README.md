# Vision Learning survey of CNN and pretrained models Keras:
A survey of DL vision models


Facial emotion recognition using the TensorFlow framework is a project that involves using machine learning algorithms to detect emotions from facial expressions in real-time. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that allows developers to build and deploy machine learning models. The project involves training a model on a dataset of facial expressions and then using that model to recognize emotions in real-time using a webcam or other camera. This technology has a wide range of applications, including in healthcare, marketing, and gaming.
